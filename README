= Exceptional Plugin for Ruby on Rails

The Exceptional plugin posts errors to getexceptional.com where we collate and notify you based on the notification mediums you set up on the site.

When an error occurs we post data about the request, session, and environment, and also a backtrace of the exception.

== Usage

Include the Exceptional::Rescuer mixin in whichever controller you want to catch error data (typically ApplicationController):

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include Exceptional::Rescuer
    ...
  end

== Configuration

Create a new file (exceptional.yml) in /config and add the following configuration line.

api-key: yourapikeyhere

And you're done. Hope you enjoy getting Exceptional! Please send any questions or comments to hello@getexceptional.com.
