= Exceptional plugin for Ruby on Rails

This plugin posts exception data to Exceptional (http://getexceptional.com). Data about the request, session, environment and a backtrace of the exception is transmitted.

= Installation

1. gem install exceptional
2. Add config.gem 'exceptional' to 'config/environment.rb'
3. Follow the instructions on http://getexceptional.com for configuring your api_key in 'config/exceptional.yml'

Other ways to install:

1. traditional rails plugin install
2. gem bundler

= Upgrading from old version of the exceptional plugin

1. Delete vendor/plugins/exceptional
2. Follow installation instructions above
3. (optional) Simplify your config/exceptional.yml file - all it needs now is a single line with 'api-key: YOUR-KEY'
