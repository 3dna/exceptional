= Exceptional Plugin for Ruby on Rails

The Exceptional plugin posts errors to getexceptional.com where we collate and notify you based on the notification mediums you set up on the site.

When an error occurs we post data about the request, session, and environment, and also a backtrace of the exception.

== Usage

The plugin is automatically initialized when the Rails application is started.

== Configuration

Create a new file (exceptional.yml) in /config and add the following configuration line.

api-key: yourapikeyhere

If there are any parameters that you would like to be filtered from the data we send back to Exceptional you can supply an additional configuration option.

filter-parameters: foo, bar, baz

By default 'password' is added to the parameter filters.

And you're done. Hope you enjoy getting Exceptional! Please send any questions or comments to hello@getexceptional.com.
